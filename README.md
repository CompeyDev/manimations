# manimations
Here you will find all the manimations I have created, using manim, an animation engine for creating math animations that 3blue1brown has created. Learn more about it here -> https://github.com/3b1b/manim <- and join the manim community's discord here -> https://discord.gg/yhJhtVKKTN <-. If you want to download the community version, check out their github repository for instructions: https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim. 

## decimal_to_frac.py
This project was created for 3blue1brown's Summer of Math Exposition, and you can find it the full video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89gvFmaczSE. It explains how to convert repeating decimals to fractions, using an infinite geometric series. It also has a short proof that 0.9 repeating = 1 (although this wasn't animated in manim.)
